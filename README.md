# GitStractor - Git Repository Analysis Tool
Project by [Matt Eland](https://LinkedIn.com/in/matteland) ([@IntegerMan](https://twitter.com/IntegerMan))

This project is built for extracting commit, author, and file data from local git repositories in order to visualize repository history and trends to provide insight to software development teams and their stakeholders.

## Editions

Currently there are two editions of GitStractor: 

- A Python prototype which works, but is slow and doesn't handle move / renames correctly
- A dotnet version which is much faster, but is still in development

Because there is no current viable option for GitStractor, I recommend you check in on this repository at a later time before using it in a project.

My current plan is to develop the dotnet version and make it available as a NuGet package, then make a series of data visualizations available to anyone who is interested.
