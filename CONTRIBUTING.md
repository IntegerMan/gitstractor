This project is still in early prototyping and active development.

If you'd like to contribute, I recommend you create an issue with your proposed changes if you have an idea for how to enhance the application.

If you're not sure how to contribute, I recommend you [contact Matt Eland](https://MattEland.dev) to see how you can get involved.
